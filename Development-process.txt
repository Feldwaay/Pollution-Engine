STAGE 1 — REQUIREMENT FREEZE (Non-Negotiable)

Before coding a single line:

1. Define Final Scope

Point-based station classification only

3 cause categories + Mixed + Uncertain

Wind-aware inference

Citizen reporting (basic)

Interactive map

Dashboard summary

No feature creep.

2. Define Technical Decisions (Lock Them)

Framework: Next.js

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Map: Leaflet

Charts: Chart.js

Hosting: Vercel

Decision fatigue kills speed. Lock it.



STAGE 2 — SYSTEM DESIGN (Professional Level)
A. Data Model Finalization

You must:

Identify all entities

Define relationships

Define indexes

Define timestamp handling

Define data retention policy

Deliverable:
ER Diagram.

B. Classification Engine Spec

You must:

Define exact formula weights

Define wind modifier thresholds

Define spike detection logic

Define classification thresholds

Define confidence calculation

Deliverable:
Written algorithm document.

No coding before this exists.

C. API Integration Plan

For each external source:

Authentication method

Rate limits

Response structure

Error handling plan

Fallback strategy

Deliverable:
Data ingestion blueprint.


STAGE 3 — CORE BACKEND BUILD
1. Project Setup

Environment variables

Database connection

Folder structure

Logging system

2. Data Ingestion Services

Separate services:

AQI Fetcher

Weather Fetcher

Traffic Fetcher

Each must:

Validate response

Normalize data

Store to DB

Handle failure gracefully

3. Spike Detection Service

Rolling average logic

Threshold logic

Event generation

Store events in DB

4. Classification Engine

Pure function module:

Takes station snapshot

Outputs structured classification object

Unit-test this.

5. Event Pipeline

Flow:

New AQI →
Check spike →
If spike → classify →
Store classification →
Expose via API


STAGE 4 — FRONTEND BUILD
1. Map Page

Must include:

Station markers

Color-coded classification badges

Wind arrow visualization

Popup with metrics

Must handle:

Loading state

Error state

2. Dashboard Page

Include:

Classification distribution chart

AQI trend graph

Recent event list

Confidence indicators

3. Citizen Reporting

Features:

Form validation

Geolocation auto-detect

Media upload handling

Voting logic

Credibility scoring


STAGE 5 — VALIDATION & EDGE CASES

You must test:

Low wind scenario

No industrial alignment

Multiple station spike

High traffic spike

Missing API response

Network failure


STAGE 6 — UI POLISH

Best standard means:

Consistent color system

Clean typography

Clear legend on map

Explanation modal for classification logic

Professional loading indicators

No default ugly buttons.


STAGE 7 — DEMO PREPARATION

You need:

Pre-loaded demo data

At least one industrial event

One vehicular event

One regional event

One stagnation event

You control the narrative.


STAGE 8 — DOCUMENTATION

Prepare:

Architecture diagram

Data flow diagram

Classification explanation slide

Limitations slide

Future scope slide

If you cannot explain it, you don’t own it.
